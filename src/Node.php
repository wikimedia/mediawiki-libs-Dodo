         *    moves it from its current
         *    position to its new position
         *    ('move' means 'remove' followed
         *    by 're-insert').
         *
         * 2. If $refNode is NULL, then $node
         *    is added to the end of the list
         *    of children of $this. In other
         *    words, insertBefore($node, NULL)
         *    is equivalent to appendChild($node).
         *
         * 3. If $node is a DocumentFragment,
         *    the children of the DocumentFragment
         *    are moved into the child list of
         *    $this, and the empty DocumentFragment
         *    is returned.
         *
         * THINGS TO KNOW IN LIFE:
         *
         * Despite its weird syntax (blame the spec),
         * this is a real workhorse, used to implement
         * all of the non-replacing insertion mutations.
