/******************************************************************************
 * Attr.php
 * --------
 * The Attr class represents a single attribute node.
 *
 * NOTE
 * The definition of the Attr class has undergone some changes in recent
 * revisions of the DOM spec.
 *
 *      DOM-2: Introduced namespaces, and the properties 'namespaceURI',
 *             'localName', and 'prefix' were defined on the Node class.
 *             As a subclass of Node, Attr inherited these.
 *
 *      DOM-4: Attr was no longer classified as a Node. The properties
 *             'namespaceURI', 'localName', and 'prefix' were removed
 *             from the Node class. They were now defined on the Attr
 *             class itself, as well as on the Element class, which
 *             remained a subclass of Node.
 *
 *      DOM-LS: Attr was re-classified as a Node, but the properties
 *              'namespaceURI', 'localName', and 'prefix' remained on
 *              the Attr class (and Element class), and did not re-appear
 *              on the Node class..
 */
/******************************************************************************
 * Qualified Names, Local Names, and Namespace Prefixes
 *
 * An Element or Attribute's qualified name is its local name if its
 * namespace prefix is null, and its namespace prefix, followed by ":",
 * followed by its local name, otherwise.
 */
/******************************************************************************
 * NOTES (taken from Domino.js)
 *
 * Attributes in the DOM are tricky:
 *
 * - there are the 8 basic get/set/has/removeAttribute{NS} methods
 *
 * - but many HTML attributes are also 'reflected' through IDL
 *   attributes which means that they can be queried and set through
 *   regular properties of the element.  There is just one attribute
 *   value, but two ways to get and set it.
 *
 * - Different HTML element types have different sets of reflected
 *   attributes.
 *
 * - attributes can also be queried and set through the .attributes
 *   property of an element.  This property behaves like an array of
 *   Attr objects.  The value property of each Attr is writeable, so
 *   this is a third way to read and write attributes.
 *
 * - for efficiency, we really want to store attributes in some kind
 *   of name->attr map.  But the attributes[] array is an array, not a
 *   map, which is kind of unnatural.
 *
 * - When using namespaces and prefixes, and mixing the NS methods
 *   with the non-NS methods, it is apparently actually possible for
 *   an attributes[] array to have more than one attribute with the
 *   same qualified name.  And certain methods must operate on only
 *   the first attribute with such a name.  So for these methods, an
 *   inefficient array-like data structure would be easier to
 *   implement.
 *
 * - The attributes[] array is live, not a snapshot, so changes to the
 *   attributes must be immediately visible through existing arrays.
 *
 * - When attributes are queried and set through IDL properties
 *   (instead of the get/setAttributes() method or the attributes[]
 *   array) they may be subject to type conversions, URL
 *   normalization, etc., so some extra processing is required in that
 *   case.
 *
 * - But access through IDL properties is probably the most common
 *   case, so we'd like that to be as fast as possible.
 *
 * - We can't just store attribute values in their parsed idl form,
 *   because setAttribute() has to return whatever string is passed to
 *   getAttribute even if it is not a legal, parseable value. So
 *   attribute values must be stored in unparsed string form.
 *
 * - We need to be able to send change notifications or mutation
 *   events of some sort to the renderer whenever an attribute value
 *   changes, regardless of the way in which it changes.
 *
 * - Some attributes, such as id and class affect other parts of the
 *   DOM API, like getElementById and getElementsByClassName and so
 *   for efficiency, we need to specially track changes to these
 *   special attributes.
 *
 * - Some attributes like class have different names (className) when
 *   reflected.
 *
 * - Attributes whose names begin with the string 'data-' are treated
 *   specially.
 *
 * - Reflected attributes that have a boolean type in IDL have special
 *   behavior: setting them to false (in IDL) is the same as removing
 *   them with removeAttribute()
 *
 * - numeric attributes (like HTMLElement.tabIndex) can have default
 *   values that must be returned by the idl getter even if the
 *   content attribute does not exist. (The default tabIndex value
 *   actually varies based on the type of the element, so that is a
 *   tricky one).
 *
 * See
 * http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/urls.html#reflect
 * for rules on how attributes are reflected.
